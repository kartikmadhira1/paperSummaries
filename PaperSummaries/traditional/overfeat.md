# OverFeat: Integrated Recognition, Localization and Detection using Convolutional Networks

Classification and localization refers to just one object being present in the image and localizing that one image. Detection refers to detecting multiple objects in an image and also give in their locations.

1. OverFeat is the first paper that addresses the goal of integrating classification, localization and detection.
2. This is done by
